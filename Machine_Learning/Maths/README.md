Variance = measure of the average distance away from the mean each number is different by


Higher variance = wider range of numbers

Lower variance = lower range of numbers



# Statistics


$$
Permutations = \frac{n!}{(n - r) !}
$$
$$
Combinations = \frac{n!}{r! x (n - r) !}
$$
$$
P(E_{1} \cup E_{2}) = P(E_{1}) + P(E_{2}) - P(E_{1} \cap E_{2})
$$
$$
P(E_{1} \cap E_{2}) = P(E_{1}) * P(E_{2} | E_{1})
$$
$$
Binomial Distribution = P(X = x) = Comb(n,x) * p^{x} * (1 - p)^{m - x}
$$
$$
Categorical data: \chi^{2} = \sum_{i = 1} ^ {I} \sum_{j = 1} ^ {J} \frac{(o_{i} - e_{ij})^{2}}{e_{ij}}
$$

## Hypothesis Testing

Must normalise to test hypothesis

Null hypothesis = No relation, basic assumption

Alternative Hypothesis = There is a relation

P - value = probability of extreme values when null hypothesis is true

If p value less than significant level, then reject null hypothesis (approve alternative)

If p value is more than significant level, accept the alternative hypothesis (reject alternative)

Level of significance = alpha = Type 1 error = reject null hypothesis although true

### Testing Types
- T Test -> Continuous variables
  - Whether 2 variables are equal or not
- Z Test -> 
  - Number of samples less than 30
  - $N_{i}$ independent
- ANOVA Test ->
  - Var between inner variance, outer variance
- Chi - square ->
  - Categorical data

## Central Limit Theory
> *Defintion* : If you have sufficently large population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ and take 
> samples (with replacement) and calculate the same mean, the distribution of these sample means with approximate the 
> normal distribution

## Normal Distribution
> *Definition* : Mean, median, mode all at center of distribution. All data with $\pm$ 3 $\sigma$

*Assumptions*
That distribution of sample means are normal
$$
x_{new} = \frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}}
$$
$$
z-score = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$
