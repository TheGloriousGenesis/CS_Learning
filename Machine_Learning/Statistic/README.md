Permutations = \frac{n!}{(n - r) !}

Combinations = \frac{n!}{r! x (n - r) !}

P(E_{1} \cup E_{2}) = P(E_{1}) + P(E_{2}) - P(E_{1} \cap E_{2})
$$
$$
P(E_{1} \cap E_{2}) = P(E_{1}) * P(E_{2} | E_{1})

$$
Binomial Distribution = P(X = x) = Comb(n,x) * p^{x} * (1 - p)^{m - x}

$$
Categorical data: \chi^{2} = \sum_{i = 1} ^ {I} \sum_{j = 1} ^ {J} \frac{(o_{i} - e_{ij})^{2}}{e_{ij}}
