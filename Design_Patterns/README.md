# Design Patterns

## Glossary

| Word | Definition|
|:----:|:---------:|
| Design Pattern | Solutions to implement that addresses issues surrounding coding software for change. |
| Observer Pattern | One to many dependency between objects, dynamically updating multiple objects depending on the change of state of given object |

## Basics
To understand design patterns, we must first understand Object-Orientated basics and principles. 

| OO basics| Definition |
|:--------:|:----------:|
| Abstraction | Ensure there is one functionality to each core piece of code/method |
| Encapsulation | Combining data and behaviour in a package and hiding implementation away from the users of the package |
| Polymorphism | Objects inheriting from same parent can be exchanged during instantiation |
| Inheritance | Child components obtain functionality and variables from parent classes |

| OO Principles | Explanation |
|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| <em> ' Encapsulates what varies ' </em> | To ensure there is no repetition of the code base |
| <em> ' Favor composition over inheritance ' </em> | To ensure flexibility, favour interfaces over class inheritance if possible|
| <em> ' Program to interface, not implementation ' </em> | To ensure flexibility and extension of code base if needed |
