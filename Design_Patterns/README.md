# Design Patterns

## Glossary

| Word | Definition|
|:----:|:---------:|
| Design Pattern | Solutions to implement that addresses issues surrounding coding software for change. |
| Observer Pattern | Dynamically updating the state of multiple variables depending on the change of information of given variable|

## Basics
To understand design patterns, we must first understand Object-Orientated basics and principles. 

| OO basics| Definition |
|:--------:|:----------:|
| Abstraction | Ensure there is one functionality to each core piece of code/method |
| Encapsulation | - |
| Polymorphism | Objects inheriting from same parent can be exchanged during instantiation |
| Inheritance | Child components obtain functionality and variables from parent classes |

| OO Principles | Explanation |
|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| <em> ' Encapsulates what varies ' </em> | To ensure there is no repetition of the code base |
| <em> ' Favor composition over inheritance ' </em> | To ensure flexibility, favour interfaces over class inheritance if possible|
| <em> ' Program to interface, not implementation ' </em> | To ensure flexibility and extension of code base if needed |
