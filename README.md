OFF THE SHELF


MCK 5 years
DS -
SE -

3 years MLE

Can rotate on assets if MLE
- More DS focus (Nicokolaos k)
    - More SE focus (Nicokoloas t, Ivan, Kiyo)
    - More asset development
    - Mixture (work more on client, Anil, Tomasz, Nicokoloas)
        - Client( to do well, have to a breadth of experience, tech stack different, different domain, short projects, at least 2 in a year, much more independent, good grasp of Kedro, scientific library stack (scikit learn, numpy), debugging, good at problem solving, communication, negotiation, expectation planning : CIO, CTO best for this
        - (Hands on, practice problems, technical challenges, personal experience interviews, wish I would of done differently)
            - (CASE STUDY: Concepts of DS: Data to decisions, why choosing model, why techniques, 3 ways techniques work for tabular xgboost, zoom in and zoom out (business outcome), responsibility of components, map to software principles, separation of concern?? constraints)
        - Asset( to do well, have depth, working on vertical, long period, good SE practice, mentorship, joint feature, plan work better so design patterns, reusable code, communication)
        - Get feedback quickly
        - Uninteresting work with client but sometimes do this, shunning that work (DevOps, CloudOps)
        -

MLE:

    - Coding:

1. Restate the question, give a basic example and an expected answer
2. Does a solution exist? Is it unique? How many solutions can there be and how do we choose which one to return?
3. Define constraints for all inputs
4. Define edge cases. What's an expected output?
5. Do we care about runtime, space or both (or neither)?
6. Solve
    - Tomasz Algorithm GITHUB
        - Hackerrank: interview kit
        - Leetcode: too 100 interview questions
        - Focus on communication
        - When asked for quick, first solution (must be brute force), as little line of code as possible (DO NOT FOCUS ON OPTIMISATION)
        - Restate the question, give example of question (state edge cases)
        - If the solution exists, if its unique, how many to return
        - Define constraints for all inputs
        - Never be given task that doesn’t keep in memory
        - Talk out loud each line of code
        - Do production level code
        - Take time to give name variables
        - System design —> cracking the coding interview
        - System design primer GITHUB (before grokking)
            - Designing uber, instagram, spotiy, no sql db (YouTube)

- System design: (end up with having a diagram)
  - Reason well
  - Why would you need something like that
  - Communication
  - Load balancing
  - Caching strategy
1. Ask a lot of questions regarding what to design. Do not jump onto solve, designing stuff. Functional and non functional requirements. Spend 5 -10 minutes (what is it? What are the main features? (Who uses, how they use it, how can data be found) its a business conversation
2. Requirements (Funcitional requirements) (user stories on jira) (user is Able to access …)(website shows list of …)(user is able to …..)written from user perspective. REPEAT FUNCITONALITY THAT YOU NEED.

   (Non functional: reliability, availability (when should application be available (consistent), CAP Theorem), latency (time dependant applications, how much time can be 	rutilise before interaction in the app), scalability (how many people, how much interaction with the application))

Extended requirements:
- Security, cost, Human Resources available, deadline, business requirements

(Don’t have diagram by this moment)
3. Estimating capacity and defining constraint
    1. Read to write ratio
    2. Traffic (what does scalability mean for traffic? Data type? What data is getting transferred ? How many versions)
    3. Storage (Binary storage, sql, no sql, metadata(usually no sql))
    4. Memory (Do we need to cache)
    5. Bandwidth (to support/requirement —> related to latency)
4. DESIGN! Most basic is (User -> server -> db)
    1. Ask if you should do high level design, or discuss API or focus on database design/ data model
    2. System APIs
    3. Data Model
    4. Database Design
    5. High-level Design

Presentation tier
Web tier
Business tier
Data tier

Have arrows! And add description to arrows
Describe each type of object in tier

API request pull html file to machine

Html protocol utp tcp web socket com munition restful api proctor

End to end flow of one request that belongs to one of the functional requirements using diagram


Dictionary lookup —> no sql
Faster than sql so good for

Scalability (duplicate servers, load balancers between client and server )

Another server for ml problem
Where batch or online inference

Go over time complexity of questions with I loop then j loop staring from I
Kadanes algorithm


Given list of millions of documents how would you find all the documents that contain a list of words? The words can appear in any order but they must be complete words. That is “book” does not match “bookkeeper”

Step 1:
- Who will it be used by?
    - Students in university
- How many users?
    - Thousands
- How many times will it be used?
    - Many times for the same documents
- How can the data be found?
    - Online
- What are the main features?
    - Search for single word in document/s
- How are the users going to access it?
    - Web application
- How will they access this service?
    - Through web application
- Amount of data
  Step 2 (User stories + Non- Fundamentals):
- Define User Stories
    - “User should be able to find documents for a given word”
    - “User should be able to find documents for a given combination of words“
    - “User should login in and see search bar for words and documents”
- Define Non-functional requirements (CAP/Scalabity)
  - Availability (When should the application be available)
  - Latency (is it ok if there is a drop of speed to get the results back?)
  - Consistency
  - Scalability (frequency of interaction) - Loads of documents being searched, important to increase load when many users accessing querying of the data.
  Step 3 (Additional):
- Security?
- Notification system
- Is there a deadline to implement this?
- How many people do we have working on this?
- Budget?
  Step 4 (Constraints (how would I fix failures)):
- Storage: How would we search through millions of documents? Storing millions of documents requires, can’t all be stored on one machine so they need to partition data across many machines. How to find data on these machines.
- What Traffic do we have to take to take into account
- If you have to search a lot of documents, there might be a delay : Possibly use asychronrous queue
- Cache: There might be multiple times a user could access the database or multiple users look for a given word so cache that data


DS Interview:

- What kind of data do you need to solve the problem
- Like Client project
- Expected to lead question data quality, where it is stored, time span, do we have documentation, centralised source, data ingestion ( look at studio for example)
- Looking for breath in features
- Hypothesis testing, feature engineering, experiment
- Unit of analysis : <— state the word. row in table used to train model and make inference
    - Primary data across the timeframe, as well as the state (active, non active, explicit) (who, what, where)
    - Once trained which circumstances will the model not work
- Feature engineering (age, gender etc?)
- Hypothesis testing
    - Categorical, data types and what to use them for
    - Read (chi square, test for normality)
- Propose simple model plus assumptions behind model:
    - Likelihood has to be gaussian distribution
